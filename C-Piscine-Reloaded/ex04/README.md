| Parameter               | Description                                                                              |

| `ifconfig`              | Command to display network interface configuration, including Ethernet interfaces.       |
| `grep ether`            | Filters the output of `ifconfig` to only include lines containing the word "ether".      |
| `awk '{print $2}'`      | Extracts the second column from each line of the filtered output (Ethernet addresses).   |

This script, when executed, will retrieve the Ethernet addresses (MAC addresses) of the network interfaces on the system.

The `|` character in Unix-like systems is known as the pipe symbol, and it's used to connect the output of one command to the input of another.
So, when you run `ifconfig | grep ether | awk '{print $2}'`, you're essentially:
1. Fetching the network interface configuration.
2. Filtering out lines that don't contain Ethernet interface information.
3. Extracting and printing the MAC addresses of the Ethernet interfaces.
