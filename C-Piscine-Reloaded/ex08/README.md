# ft_is_negative.c

This function takes a number (let's call it **n**) as input. It checks whether **n** is negative or not.

- If **n** is less than 0, it means it's negative. In that case, the function prints 'N'.
- If **n** is greater than or equal to 0, it means it's positive or zero. In that case, the function prints 'P'.

So, in essence, this function determines the sign of the given number and prints 'N' for negative numbers and 'P' for non-negative numbers.
