Create the Makefile that’ll compile your libft.a.
- The Makefile will get its source files from the "srcs" directory.
- The Makefile will get its header files from the "includes" directory.
- The lib will be at the root of the exercise.
- The Makefile should also implement the following rules: clean, fclean and re as well as all.
- fclean does the equivalent of a make clean and also erases the binary created during the make. re does the equivalent of a make fclean followed by a make.
- We’ll only fetch your Makefile and test it with our files. For this exercise, only the following 5 mandatory functions of your lib have to be handled : (ft_putchar, ft_putstr, ft_strcmp, ft_strlen and ft_swap)
