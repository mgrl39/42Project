# Exercise 00 : Oh yeah, mooore...
To solve this exercise you can copy and paste the command:
```shell
mkdir test0 && chmod 715 test0 && touch -t 06012047 test0 && echo -n "4242" > test1 && chmod 714 test1 && touch -t 06012146 test1 && mkdir test2 && chmod 504 test2 && touch -t 06012245 test2 && echo -n "1" > test3 && chmod 404 test3 && touch -t 06012344 test3 && echo -n "42" > test4 && chmod 641 test4 && touch -t 06012343 test4 && ln test3 test5 && ln -s test0 test6 && touch -ht 06012220 test6 && ls -l
```
