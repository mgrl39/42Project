```shell
echo -n "42" > \"\\\?\$\*\'MaRViN\'\*\$\?\\\" && touch -t 10021221 \"\\\?\$\*\'MaRViN\'\*\$\?\\\" && chmod 614 \"\\\?\$\*\'MaRViN\'\*\$\?\\\"
```

I think is not necesary change the date and permissions.
If you'd like to test just the creation of the file with the content "42" inside, go ahead and give it a try!
