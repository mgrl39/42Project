### Purpose of the Code
This function, `ft_count_if`, counts how many strings in an array of strings meet a certain condition.

### Components of the Function
1. **Parameters:**
   - `char **tab`: This is an array of strings (each string is a `char *`).
   - `int (*f)(char*)`: This is a function pointer. It points to a function that takes a string (`char*`) as an argument and returns an integer.

2. **Local Variables:**
   - `int i`: This is used to keep track of the current index in the array `tab`.
   - `int count`: This keeps track of how many strings meet the condition defined by the function

```c
int	ft_count_if(char **tab, int (*f)(char*))
{
	int	i;
	int	count;

	count = 0;
	i = 0;
	while (tab[i] != 0)
	{
		if (f(tab[i]) == 1)
			count++;
		i++;
	}
	return (count);
}
```

### How It Works
1. **Initialization:**
   - `count` is set to 0. This will be used to count how many strings meet the condition.
   - `i` is set to 0. This will be used to iterate through the array `tab`.

2. **Loop Through the Array:**
   - The `while` loop continues as long as the current string (`tab[i]`) is not `0` (or `NULL`). This means it stops when it reaches the end of the array.

3. **Check Condition:**
   - Inside the loop, `f(tab[i])` is called. This means the function `f` is applied to the current string `tab[i]`.
   - If `f(tab[i])` returns `1`, it means the current string meets the condition. When this happens, `count` is incremented by 1.

4. **Move to the Next String:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 to move to the next string in the array.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - After the loop has checked all strings, the function returns `count`, which is the number of strings that met the condition.

### Example
Let's say `tab` is an array of strings: `{"hello", "world", "42", 0}` and `f` is a function that returns `1` if the string contains a digit and `0` otherwise.

- `f("hello")` returns `0`
- `f("world")` returns `0`
- `f("42")` returns `1`

The function `ft_count_if` will return `1` because only one string ("42") meets the condition defined by `f`.

### In Simple Terms
This function goes through each string in an array, checks if it meets a specific condition (defined by another function), and counts how many strings meet that condition. It returns the total count.
