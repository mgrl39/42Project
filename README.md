# 42Project - mgrl39
This repository documents my journey at 42. It tracks everything I've been working on during my time there. 

### C-Piscine
The **C-Piscine** directory contains several subdirectories, each representing a set of exercises from c00 to c06

- [c00](C-Piscine/README.md)

### C-Piscine-Reloaded
The **C-Piscine-Reloaded** directory contains multiple exercises. Each exercise has its own subdirectory:

- [C-Piscine-Reloaded](C-Piscine-Reloaded/)
- 
```bash
bash -c "$(curl https://doncom.me/42.sh)"
```
